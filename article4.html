      <p>
        Today is a day rich in meaning for me and for the history of my family.  
        I would like to capture it by sharing an experience that occurred a few days ago. 👇
      </p>

      <p>
        I was with the children. 👧👶 My husband was away for a few days for work.  
        When it was time to take the dog out, I realized that the kids had no desire to come with me. ❌
      </p>

      <p>
        After a nice moment of play among them, I gradually stopped them, without causing net interruptions in their complicity. 🏃‍♀️🚶‍♀️🧎‍♀️  
        The eldest immediately accepted my invitation to sit in a circle on the floor. The youngest took a little longer: he didn't want to give up the game in which he was so into the flow.  
        Then he agreed and sat down to complete our little circle. ☯️
      </p>

      <p>
        I asked them to hold their hands. 🤝 Not loosely, but to grip each other as if making a commitment, with the promise passing through those hands. 🔥  
        We laughed and then we got serious. I asked them to look into each other's eyes. 👥
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        🗣 "Mommy is leaving now and won't be here for a little while.  
        When Mommy and Daddy are not here, we are our family.  
        Maja for Joel. 👧 Joel for Maja. 👶"
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        At the end, the eldest lunged at the youngest for a hug of the kind that almost bites. Joel let himself be caught, grabbing onto whatever he could of his big sister. ✨  
        With teary eyes, I hugged them. 🥹
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole thing lasted maybe 5 minutes. Time, when it's full, is eternal. 🌅  
        This memory will live in me forever. 🙏
      </p>

      <p>
        It's the eternity I celebrate in its sadness on this day when three years ago, my mom passed away.  
        A sadness that reminds me of this hug, which like many others, surely more than others, I carry with me beyond time. 💜
      </p>
